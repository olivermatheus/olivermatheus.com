            Due to unforseen circumstances, I cannot ask this in person. I also can't risk waiting till I get better just for another man to scoop you up. I need you to always be a part of my life, Yitzel. Every time without fail, my heart feels lighter when I see you. I go stupid and mute when I lay eyes on you, cause I don't know how to say you look beautiful for the 1000000th time without sounding shallow. I'm genuinely never fully prepared. That's always right before you make me feel so warm and safe and inevitably make me laugh with something I never could have predicted. With the way you shine in my life, I don't know how I ever found my way before, but my eyes are adjusted now, and I can't go back to the dark. You are the highlight of my hour, day, week, and month all at once when I'm with you. Please read the following question with the upmost seriousness.
